# WebMon
A Google App Engine hosted application to monitor user chosen websites and provide real time notifications about down times and response times.

## How it works
You can try it here: https://cs263-webmon.appspot.com/

1. Sign Up<br />
Visit the signup page to sign up for the application. No open access is allowed.

2. Log In<br />
Log in with your shiny new credentials.

3. Add a website<br />
In your dashboard, click on 'Add website'. Give your website a name, the URL in required format and click on 'Add website'.

4. Check response time and get notified<br />
Give it some time (current ping time is 30 min) and check the response graph of website you added by clicking on the website name in your dashboard.

**Note**: You can get response times by pinging /response. Be careful not to overload the server. If the free tier quota expires, the application will be shutdown by app engine.
